Viewfield
======================

Defines a field type to display a view.

Nodes hold content. Views save queries. Wouldn't be great if a node could hold a
saved query? Now it can.

Viewfield is a field type module that allows to render a particular view within
a field of an entity. When creating an entity, users can select the view to
render from a list of views. When the entity is displayed, the view is run and
the content is inserted into the field.
